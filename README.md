### Hi there 👋

My name is Ali Kemal, most people call me Ali. I'm 16 years old and I usually work on C++, Python and JavaScript, sometimes C#.


I've always been keen on computers and kind of stuff since I was 8 years old. My first experience with coding was with HTML. After some time I worked with it, I started to learn programming languages such as Python. I'm currently improving myself with doing basic projects for now.


The languages I use the most are C++ and Python. My knowledge on C++ is not that enough but I'm still improving myself.
